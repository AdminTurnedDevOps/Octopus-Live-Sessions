## Skylines Academy Summer Session
The session that I will be presenting at for Skylines Academy is on Octopus Deploy and Azure.

I will be showing how to:
1. Create a new Octopus Deploy project group with Terraform
2. Create a new Octopus Deploy project with Octopus CLI
3. Create a new Octopus Deploy account with the UI
4. The step will use Azure CLI to create a new resource group
